## TodayPay!

As a college student, there are many bills I need to pay such as rent, student loans, groceries, etc; however, I only receive my paycheck every two weeks, making it hard to pay these bills on time. TodayPay would be partnered with companies to help fix this problem! TodayPay is a time clock app where it allows employees to clock in and out, then are able to see and get their money in real time! With a sleek and easy design to clock in and out, this will improve the productivity of employees and stimulate positive reinforcement. 

Here are the 7 technologies I need to use:

HTML - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for clocking in, and one for the page after you pay roll. 

CSS - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.

JavaScript - Provides login, clock display, shows the pay, display other users clock in schedules.

React - Single page application with views componentized and reactive to user's actions.

Service - Backend service with endpoints for:
retreiving time
submitting pay
retrieving time status

DB/Login - Employee users and time database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't clock in/out unless authenticated.

WebSocket - As each user clocks in and out, it is broadcasted to all the users.
