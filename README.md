TodayPay!

As a college student, there are many bills I need to pay such as rent, student loans, groceries, etc; however, I only receive my paycheck every two weeks, making it hard to pay these bills on time. TodayPay would be partnered with companies to help fix this problem! 

Here are the 7 technologies I need to use:

1. HTML:
2. CSS:
3. JavaScript/React: Clock in and out, start the time and ends it. 
4. Web service:
5. Authentication: Login, put in personal information
6. Database data: Past pay, past hours worked, transactions
7. WebSocket data: Time, pay
