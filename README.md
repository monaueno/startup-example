TodayPay!

As a college student, there are many bills I need to pay such as rent, student loans, groceries, etc; however, I only receive my paycheck every two weeks, making it hard to pay these bills on time. TodayPay would be partnered with companies to help fix this problem! TodayPay is a time clock app where it allows employees to clock in and out, then are able to get their money in real time! 

Here are the 7 technologies I need to use:

HTML - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for voting. Hyperlinks to choice artifact.
CSS - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
JavaScript - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, display other users votes, backend endpoint calls.
React - Single page application with views componentized and reactive to user's actions.
Service - Backend service with endpoints for:
retrieving choices
submitting votes
retrieving vote status

DB/Login - Store users, choices, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't vote unless authenticated.
WebSocket - As each user votes, their votes are broadcast to all other users. also...
